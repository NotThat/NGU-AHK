You'll need the current version of AHK from https://www.autohotkey.com/

Download the .ahk file to your computer, and run it.

There are 2 ways of building a layout, either from a file on your computer or from clipboard.

With the NGU INDUSTRIES game window active on the map screen, pressing F1 will place the layout from a file called 1.json in the same directory as the script.
Pressing F2 will place the layout stored in the clipboard.
